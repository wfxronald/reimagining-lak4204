## 제1과: 한국 대학교에서 공부하기 위해서 한국말을 배워요
### -기 위해서
A grammar used to describe purpose or reason. -기 turns any verb into a noun. Noun + (을/를) + 위해서 is also a common construction.

### 이라서
Used as noun + 이라서. Shortened form of (이)라고 하다 + 아/어서, it conveys the same meaning as 이어서.

## 제2과: 한국 노래를 들으면서 숙제를 해요
### -으면 -을수록
This means "the more ..., the more ..." and the first part of the grammatical structure (-으면) is often dropped.

### -으면서

## 제3과: 주말에는 문을 안 열걸요
