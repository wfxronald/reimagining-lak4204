## 제8과: 목이 아픈 데다가 자꾸 기침이 나요
### -는 데다가
Conveys the meaning of "on top of ..." and has a very similar meaning with the grammatical point -을 뿐만 아니라.

### -나 보다
Yet another grammar point to express guesses or predictions based on observations.

## 제9과: 약을 먹었는데도 낫지 않아요
### -는데도
Conveys the meaning of "even though I have done this thing, it does not seem to work".

### -네요
An ending to express your realisation of something new.

## 제10과: 운동을 해야 건강하게 체중을 줄일 수 있어요
### -어야
Means "only if you do one thing, then something else will occur".

### -을래요?
Inviting others to do something similar to -을까요?, but this structure is more concerned about the listener's opinion, while -을까요 is equally concerned about the listener's and the speaker's opinion.

## 제11과: 초대를 받았는데 빈손으로 갈 수는 없잖아요
### -잖아요
Emphasising the fact that the listener should already know. Comparable to the use of "I told you that ..., right?" in English.

### -지 그래요?
Making a suggestion, roughly means "shouldn't you have done this instead?".

## 제12과: 쇼핑백 안에 뭐가 들어 있습니까?
### -어 있다
Describes the current state of an object of a being.

### -는 대로
Describes an action being done in a particular way. It can also be used to express that something happens right after another one, similar to -자마자.

## 제13과: 다들 얼마나 만나고 싶었는지 몰라요
### 얼마나 -는지 모르다
Conveys the meaning "you don't know how much I ...".

### -던
To indicate an action that you regularly do in the past, or an action that was interrupted and not completed.

## 제14과: 창가 자리로 달라고 하세요
### -을 테니까
Used when providing a supposed reason to a suggestion. This reason is usually just a supposition or conjecture, so it is not as strong as -으니까. Often used when conveying the following: "since I'll do this, so could you please do that?".

### -어 달라고 하다
Indirect speech form for request.

## 제15과: 일 년 더 있게 됐어요
### -게 되다
No intention of doing it, but I ended up doing this. Usually used to describe something that you did not intend to do, or reluctantly do because you were made to do it.

### -어야겠다
Indicates the speaker's strong intention of doing something.
